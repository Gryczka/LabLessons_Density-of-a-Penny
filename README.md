# Density of a Penny - A LabLessons Interactive Chemistry Lab Simulation
Density of a Penny was developed as part of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering's [Science Outeach and Research Program (SOAR)](https://wp.nyu.edu/tandonschoolofengineering-soar/about/)

The lab highlights the differences in precision offered by different means of measurement.
